5-0 RIR (reps in reserve), 30% to 85% 1RM (repetition max) is our effective load (tension producing) stimulus range


rep range of around 10-20 for best mind-muscle connection for most people. Good for isolation exercises


should only be as full a ROM as is effective, safe, and logical in the long-term timescale of training, while conserving the intent of the exercise. In simple terms, do a ROM that gets you a good stretch, a good contraction, and don’t sweat the details too much.


if you’re in control of the weights and you’re not taking more than three seconds on any of the concentric, pause, or eccentric phase, you’re probably getting maximum or near-maximum stimulus


In real life training, you can go through this checklist very easily between sets to see if you’re recovered enough to go again. Below is an example checklist using chest training.
1. Are my pecs still burning from the last set?
2. Are my front delts and triceps ready to support my chest in another set?
3. Do I feel mentally and physically like I can push hard with my chest again?
4. Is my breathing more or less back to normal?

Most straight sets will have rest times of between 30 seconds and about four minutes. Thirty seconds for smaller, weaker muscles in smaller, weaker lifters with good cardiovascular fitness and up to four minutes in larger, stronger muscles in larger, stronger lifters with poorer cardiovascular fitness. Where your specific sets fall in rest times will depend only on when you can answer the four rest time constraint questions to give yourself the all-clear for another productive set. Keeping rest times consistent is also important for tracking performance. If you take longer and longer rests times across a mesocycle, you may fool yourself into thinking performance is stable, when it would actually be getting worse with matched conditions (same rest times).


Down sets are straight sets done with an intentionally lighter load, after having done straight sets with a heavier load until productive training with that load could not continue. For example, you have five sets of bent-rows at the 10-20 rep range. Your first three sets are 17, 13 and 10 reps. For the next sets, you are probably too fatigued to continue using the same weight and stay on the 10-20 rep range so you lower the weight.

Giant sets refer to a series of sets done to reach a total rep goal, using a constant load and without regard to the number of reps per set or total sets. For example, you might choose the 10kg dumbbells for lateral raises, and set a goal of 50 reps. Then, with every set but the last being stopped at between 5-0 RIR, you do as many sets as it takes to sum up a total of 50 reps. They can also provide an opportunity to focus on working muscle awareness. For example, you might feel your rhomboids, your teres major, your biceps, and even your forearms, but have trouble feeling your lats, the target muscle, in lat pulldowns. This will be easier to focus on when not assessing RIR. Giant sets free your mind up to focus on just working muscle awareness and rep counting. Finally, giant sets are an option when you have little control over load progression. For example, if you do lateral raises with the 10kg and the next set of dumbbells are 15kg - this is a big jump for this lift. If you tried to progress directly form 10kg to 15kg, your reps per set will fall off by massive margins. Instead, you can do this giant set style by adding total reps over many sets each week while keeping the weight the same until you are ready to move up to the next option. The big downside to giant sets is that it's very difficult to compare performance from week to week.

Non-overlapping involve doing a straight set with an exervise for a given muscle followed immediately by a straight set with an exercise that targets that muscle's antagonist or an unrelated muscle. For example, doing a set of leg presses and for quads and then immediately doing a set of stiff-legged deadlifts for the hams. By doing this, you are saving time by not resting between the two sets. In the case of using antagonist muscles, the antagonists limit force production of agonist movements to some extent, so when they fatigue, performance might actually go up in their counterparts. For example, if you tire out your lats before doing incline presses, they pull down on your upper arms less during inclines and thus your incline perfomance might actually improve. This is true up until systemic fatigue accumulates enough to inhibit performance. Because non-overlapping supersets can create quite a bit of systemic fatigue however, and have you switching between opposing movements, they are not conducive to the best working muscle awareness and are for that reason not the best idea if you are not time constrained.

Pre-exhaust supersets target overlapping muscle groups purposefully. You perform an isolation movement for a target muscle first (pre-exhausting it), and then, with minimal rest, perform a compound movement that involves that same muscle group. For example, triceps pushdowns, and right after, perform push-ups with a close grip. The purpose of this method is to pre-fatigue the target muscle with the isolation movement so that it becomes the limiting factor in the compound movement. This method allows the target muscle to accumulate more "effective reps" in that second movement as it will be close to failure from the pre-exhausting movement. Sometimes a compound movement is limited by the early fatigue of a synergist muscle that is not the target muscle for that exercise. For example, if you have easily fatigable front delts or chest, you may never get a chance to feel your triceps much in close grip pressing because the chest and front delts fail far before the triceps are fully stimulated. But if you pre-exhaust the triceps with an isolation set, they can become the limiting factor in the close grip pressing and can be effectively stimulated with that compound movement. This method also allows the target muscle to accumulate more metabolites than it would with just the isolation movement alone. By bringing in other muscles to assist the pre-exhausted muscle during the compound movement, the target muscle is able to get more stimulus than if you just did straight sets, and metabolite accumulation gets that much more of a boost.The target muscle also gets a bigger pump than it would with just the isolation movement alone. The added volume of work and metabolite accumulation causes an impressive degree of cell swelling in the target muscle. The rep range on the isolation set of a pre-exhaust superset should be the 10-20 rep range. The load for the compound exercise in the superset should be light enough to allow for at least five reps to be completed, and preferably between 5-10 reps. The downside of this method is that they fatigue the target muscle considerably, making them innapropriate for use at the beginning of a training session in many cases. Pre-exhaust supersets are best done in the 2-3 RIR or lower range for largest growth effects. This type of superset can be used fairly regularly but is best saved for muscles that have been tough to target.

Myoreps - the first set is typically in the 10-20 rep range, 0-2 RIR. Rest times are limited to just a few breaths between sets and subsequent sets should be around 5-10 reps with 0-2 RIR. You continue this pattern until you have completed all planned sets. The purpose of these short rest periods is to maximize the ratio of “effective reps” to the total number of reps performed over all of the sets. This only has the desired effect if the limiting factor in each set is the fatigue of the target musculature (rather than any synergistic muscle or systemic factors). As a general rule, then, compound, large-muscle-mass exercises in which the lifter has to support himself against gravity produce a lot of central, cardiorespiratory, and synergist fatigue relative to local fatigue, and thus are poor choices for myoreps. On the other hand, isolation exercises, especially those without major synergists, are very good choices for myoreps. This is a method of training that can train the faster fibers, generate metabolites, and a decent pump. Because they demand slightly more failure proximity on average than straight sets, they are quite fatiguing, especially cumulatively over the weeks. Mmyoreps don’t allow much volume to be accumulated outside of the 5-0 RIR spectrum. Although pre-5 RIR reps are not the most growth-promoting, they still have some effect and limiting them might prevent maximum growth for some of the slower fibers. Slower fibers do in fact grow (just not as much as faster fibers), so a program should not train only faster fibers and thus should not consist of only myoreps. They should be using sparingly (probably once per session at most) and toward the end of any individual sessions after straight sets have been completed and should also generally be limited to isolation movements.

Drop sets involve doing sets to 3 RIR or less, resting just long enough for the burn to fade, then reducing the weight before each subsequent set. A good practice for drop sets is to set a minimum rep number for all sets and to drop the weight enough to stay just above that number. Your first set, as with myoreps, should be between 10 and 20 reps. After the first set, you rest just long enough for the burn to go away and then drop the weight so that you can get between 5 and 10 reps in that next set, repeating this for a chosen number of sets. If the reps ever drop below 5, the weight needs to come down further than planned in the next set, and if the reps come above 10 (for any but the first set), no drop is needed. Drop sets do very much what myoreps do, but they probably target the slower fibers a bit more. The best place for drop sets is at the ends of workouts when a good combination of pump and metabolite accumulation is desired, but a shorter rest than possible with myoreps is preferred. Please note that drop sets have all of the same limitations as myoreps and should not make up the majority of training volumes. Likewise, drop sets should be limited to mainly isolation movements.

Occlusion training is an interesting way to make the target muscle in an exercise more of a limiting factor. In occlusion training, this aim is achieved by occluding blood flow to the target muscle and thus preventing metabolites from escaping into the bloodstream as quickly—leading to better metabolite accumulation. To do this, you can tie bands just below your knees for example, and do calf raises. This makes occlusion training perfect for maintaining muscle when recovering from injury. Occlusion training is also limited to those muscles that can be effectively occluded—you cannot do much to stop blood flow to your back or abdominal muscles for example. When doing occlusion training, please follow all of the caveats for drop sets and myoreps, such as using this tool minimally and saving it for later in the training session.


Progressing across some combination of load, sets, reps, and proximity to failure, with a focus on volume is probably best.

Load progression - One simple and effective option for load progression is just to increase as much as needed to stay within target RIRs, while keeping your reps similar. For example, if you plan four weeks of progression, you might target 4,3,2,1 RIR across weeks one, two, three, and four of your progression respectively. To keep reps similar, but get closer to failure each week, adding weight weekly might be needed.

Rep progression - If you choose to progress in reps rather than load, you will still be guided by the RIR roadmap—without load additions, adding reps will likely be needed to progress in proximity to failure across weeks. For rep progression, it’s important to always keep your rep range targets in the back of your mind. For example, if you set your rep range as 10-20, and by week three you’re doing 20 reps in your first set, you should probably consider adding weight in the fourth week, to prevent leaving your target rep range that week. Rep progressions are also very useful when available weight increments are too large. For example, let’s say you’re lateral raising 15lb dumbbells with a 10-20 rep target range. If you average around 13 reps per set in week one and the next dumbbells up are 20lb, increasing weight in week two will almost definitely push you below 10 reps (and out of your target range). Instead of making such a large weight jump, you can increase reps with the 15lb dumbbells, maybe averaging 15 reps per set in week two and 17 in week three and so on. Once you break the 20 rep ceiling, you can go up to the 20lb dumbbells and will probably be able to get an average of around 10 reps with that weight by then.

Set progression - Sets are probably the best proxy for volume, and this is where MEV (Minimum Effective Volume) and MRV  (Maximum Recoverable Volume) come into play. Starting your training at MEV will allow for effective training across a longer progression, but in order to start there, we must know how to find MEV:
a. On a scale of 0-3 how much did the session challenge your target muscles?
    0: You felt barely aware of your target muscles during the exercise
    1: You felt like your target muscles worked, but mildly
    2: You felt a good amount of tension and or burn in the target muscles
    3: You felt tension and burn close to the limit in your target muscles
b. On a scale of 0-3 how much pump did you experience in the target muscles?
    0: You got no pump at all in the target muscles
    1: You got a very mild pump in the target muscles
    2: You got a decent pump in the target muscles
    3: You got close to maximal pump in the target muscles
c. On a scale of 0-3 how much did the session disrupt your target muscles?
    0: You had no fatigue, perturbation, or soreness in the target muscles
    1: You had some weakness and stiffness after the session in the target muscles, but recovered by the next day
    2: You had some weakness and stiffness in the target muscles after the session and had some soreness the following day
    3: You got much weaker and felt perturbation in the target muscles right after the
       session and also had soreness for a few days or more
       
Add up the scores for each metric to total between 0 - 9.
0-1 -> stimulus likely below MEV -> increase volume the following week by two to four sets
2-3 -> stimulus likely at or below MEV -> increase volume the following week by two to four sets
4-6 -> stimulus likely at or just above MEV (a great palce to start a mesocycle) -> progress normally
7-9 -> stimulus likely between MAV (Maxiumum Adaptive Volume) and MRV, possibly exceeding MRV -> drop volume the following        week

Once you get through your first week at MEV, you can look back on it and decide how to progress in sets using the this “Set Progression Algorithm”:
a. On a scale of 0-3 how sore did you get in the target muscles?
    0: You did not get at all sore in the target muscles
    1: You got stiff for a few hours after training and had mild soreness in the target muscles that resolved by next              session targeting the same muscles
    2: You got DOMS in the target muscles that resolved just in time for the next session targeting the same muscles
    3: You got DOMS in the target muscles that remained for the next session targeting the same muscles
b. On a scale of 0-3 how was your performance?
    0: You hit your target reps, but either had to do 2 more reps than planned to hit target RIR or you hit your target            reps at 2 or more reps before target RIR
    1: You hit your target reps, but either had to do 0-1 more reps than planned to hit target RIR or you hit your target          reps at 1 rep before target RIR
    2: You hit your target reps after your target RIR
    3: You could not match last week’s reps at any RIR
 
Note that in the above description, “target reps” refer to the goal reps for that week. If you are progressing via weight and you curled 60lb for 10,8,6 reps last week, your goal this week at 65lb should be 10,8,6 again. If you are progressing on reps the target reps might be 11,9,7 with 60lb. Also note, these apply to the average of all sets in an exercise, so if you had a few amazing sets and a few very tough sets, for example, you would average those results when choosing your score. For week one of a mesocycle score performance as 1-2. Note that no matter how little soreness you are experiencing, if you score a 2 or higher on (lack of) performance you should not add sets and if you score a 3, you should employ recovery strategies.

So, in order to achieve progressive overload across straight set training, you find your MEV (using our MEV estimator), then start from MEV and add sets in proportion to your recovery (using our progression algorithm). Because your body adapts faster to volume than to weight increases in most cases, you’ll usually find that you can add quite a few sets over the course of your mesocycles even if you cannot increase weight weekly. As with load, because of the way cumulative fatigue is summed, it’s almost always better to low-ball the volume at the beginning of the program rather than get too ambitious too soon. You can always add more sets, but reducing excessive fatigue means stopping or heavily modifying the program, which highly interferes with results.

For most individuals, an accumulation phase (the path from MEV to MRV) will last between 3-8 weeks, with the majority of intermediates and advanced lifters falling in the 4-6 week range. If your mesocycles are within these ranges and you get to the final week thinking “there is no way I could handle one more week of accumulation,” you’re probably on the right track with your program design!

Instead of trying to optimally stimulate every muscle in every session, programming to prioritize certain muscle groups, but still hit others each session is beneficial. If you have three pushing sessions per week, you might do chest first on one of them, triceps first on the next, and front delts first on the last one so that each gets a day to be prioritized, but all are worked on all three days. You can also make use of this “pulsatility” in terms of the fiber type you target. For example, the 5-10 rep range targets the highest threshold motor units. Faster twitch motor units likely take longer to recover than slower twitch, so if you do chest first in the 5-10 rep range on Monday and fatigue the faster fibers, they might still be fatigued on Wednesday when it’s time to hit the pushing muscles again28. Slower twitch fibers on the other hand, might be mostly healed by then, so lighter chest training can be beneficial. Now you’re still training chest on both days and healing fast enough to prevent too much fatigue in either fiber type. An added bonus of such training is that because your connective tissues take the most damage with the heaviest training, the lighter training days are unlikely to cause or exacerbate any macro-tearing of those structures.
