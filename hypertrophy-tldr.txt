5-0 RIR (reps in reserve), 30% to 85% 1RM (repetition max) is our effective load (tension producing) stimulues range

rep range of around 10-20 for best mind-muscle connection for most people. Good for isolation exercises

should only be as full a ROM as is effective, safe, and logical in the long-term timescale of training, while conserving the intent of the exercise. In simple terms, do a ROM that gets you a good stretch, a good contraction, and don’t sweat the details too much.

if you’re in control of the weights and you’re not taking more than three seconds on any of the concentric, pause, or eccentric phase, you’re probably getting maximum or near-maximum stimulus

In real life training, you can go through this checklist very easily between sets to see if you’re recovered enough to go again. Below is an example checklist using chest training.
1. Are my pecs still burning from the last set?
2. Are my front delts and triceps ready to support my chest in another set?
3. Do I feel mentally and physically like I can push hard with my chest again?
4. Is my breathing more or less back to normal?
